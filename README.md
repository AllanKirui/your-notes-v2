## My process :gear:

---

I was actually reading a newspaper when the idea of creating a grid layout resembling the front page of a newspaper came to me 😅

<br/>

### Built with :hammer_and_wrench: :pencil: :triangular_ruler:

- HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

<br/>

### What I learned 🎓

Plenty of CSS Grid and how to apply it to layouts that are more suitable for Grid.

<br/>

### Continued development :stopwatch:

Going forward, I feel much more confident using CSS Grid in projects.

<br>

### Useful resources 💎

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape SVG Editor. I use it all the time when I'm working on any web project. After designing the project, I used Inkscape's in-built tools to help me figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project. To better understand how I approached coding the project using Inkscape, have a look at this repository I made - [Designing and Coding Layouts](https://github.com/AllanKirui/designing-and-coding-layouts)
