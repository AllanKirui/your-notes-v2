- Who said you can't have fun while programming? This particular screenshot shows one of the errors that might occur when trying to communicate with **Firestore**. However, it is highly unlikely that a user will ever experience this type of error, unless they are dabbling in the **source code**. Hence, why I dubbed the error an '**_Epic Bug_**' üòÖ

Screenshot of the **Todos** page running on my **local development server**.

- I wanted to add something special for users of **Your Notes v2** - Any user that signs up to the site with an **Email** and **Password** gets to have a really cool, randomly generated **avatar** for their profile (_top-right_).
- As for user's who choose to sign up with **Google**, the profile photo from their Google account, if any, would be used instead. However, if they haven't set any profile photo, they too would get an **avatar** generated for them. #MadeWithüß°

### Links üîó

- Live Site URL: [Your Notes v2](https://allankirui.github.io/your-notes-v2/)

<br/>

### Quickstart guide üìú

To run the code, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer.
2. You might need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the following steps.
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the repository.
4. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install required dependencies (This will create a **node_modules** folder.)
5. Run `npm run serve` to bring up the development server. You can view the app at **localhost:8080**
   (or whichever port is shown in your terminal).

<br/>

## My process :gear:

---

Since **Your Notes v2** is an updated version of [Your Notes](https://github.com/AllanKirui/YourNotes/), I already knew that I wanted to make a to-do/notes app. I looked over the features of the original version of the app and wrote down all the things that I could improve upon.

With the list in hand, I began the design process, coming up with wireframes and adding details such as colors, layouts and typography to the designs. After the initial design phase, I finally came up with a passable design.

Having captured most of my ideas about the app, I initialized the Vue app and started meeting the design requirements one line of code at a time. üèÅ

<br/>

### Built with :hammer_and_wrench: :pencil: :triangular_ruler:

- HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - An app development platform that helps you build and grow apps and games users love.

<br/>

### What I learned üéì

The time I spent working on this project was a worthwhile way for me to continue practicing my Vue skills. These are some of the things I learned:

- **Vue transitions and animations**

  - I learned how to use Vue's `transition` component to set up transitions and animations that would otherwise be difficult to implement on elements that are conditionally rendered on screen.

  - I also learned how I could animate list items using the `transition-group` component. This was very handy in animating notifications in the app that can at times get stacked up.

  - With the `transition` component, it was also possible to add animations to the components that are loaded through routing. I thought it best to animate only the **SignUp** and **LogIn** pages.

- **Vue slots**

  - Earlier on, I had learnt about `slots`, but I never really found a use case for them like I did in **Your Notes v2**.

- **state management with Vuex**

  - Since I had learnt a bit about **Vuex** at the time I started working on this app, I decided that the app would be a great place to manage global application wide state with **Vuex**.

- **Firebase integration**

  - I was able to intergrate Firebase into the app (something I had not done in the original version of the app). Once the app was connected to Firebase, I chose to use Firebase's **Cloud Firestore** as my backend solution. I looked through the documentation and other useful resources to learn how I would get up and running with it.

- **progressive web applications**
  - I'm not an expert in PWAs, but through [Ahmad Karimzade's article](https://medium.com/@ahmadkzx/vue-offline-page-fbae11e7c3b7) on creating a Vue offline page, I was able to add simple PWA functionality to **Your Notes v2**.

I'm glad I chose to make an updated version of **Your Notes**. I was able to add many of the lacking features from the original version. **Your Notes v2** features a better UI/UX experience, improved code architecture, Firebase integration, and everything I've learnt since making the original version ‚ò∫Ô∏è

<br/>

**Here's some of the code that I'm proud of** üòé

I'm proud of the entire app, but here's one honorable mention.

Using the `transition-group` component to animate list items for the notifications.

It renders an unorderered list and within it. It then loops through _notification items_ in the _notificationQueue_ creating list items, adjusting the position of each _notification item_ if there are multiple.

```html
<transition-group tag="ul" name="notification">
  <li
    class="notification-item"
    v-for="(notification, index) in notificationQueue"
    :key="index"
    :style="`position: absolute; bottom: ${index * 50}px`"
  >
    <base-card :mode="cardStyle">
      <p class="message">{{ notification.message }}</p>
    </base-card>
  </li>
</transition-group>
```

<br/>

### Continued development :stopwatch:

Going forward, I want to continue learning more about frontend development and to practice what I already know by tackling more projects built with **Vue**. Applying the features and best practices that I've learned from working on this project.
