- It shows one of the many notifications that are available (_bottom-left_). The current notification shows up when a user deletes a note or a todo. I thought it would be funny to include [textfaces](https://textfac.es) and the textface on this particular notification looks like someone's throwing out something üòÑ

Screenshot of the **Notes** page running on my **local development server**.

- Who said you can't have fun while programming? This particular screenshot shows one of the errors that might occur when trying to communicate with **Firestore**. However, it is highly unlikely that a user will ever experience this type of error, unless they are dabbling in the **source code**. Hence, why I dubbed the error an '**_Epic Bug_**' üòÖ

Screenshot of the **Todos** page running on my **local development server**.

- I wanted to add something special for users of **Your Notes v2** - Any user that signs up to the site with an **Email** and **Password** gets to have a really cool, randomly generated **avatar** for their profile (_top-right_).
- As for user's who choose to sign up with **Google**, the profile photo from their Google account, if any, would be used instead. However, if they haven't set any profile photo, they too would get an **avatar** generated for them. #MadeWithüß°

## My process :gear:

---

I was actually reading a newspaper when the idea of creating a grid layout resembling the front page of a newspaper came to me üòÖ

<br/>

### Built with :hammer_and_wrench: :pencil: :triangular_ruler:

- HTML5
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor

<br/>

### What I learned üéì

Plenty of CSS Grid and how to apply it to layouts that are more suitable for Grid.

<br/>

### Continued development :stopwatch:

Going forward, I feel much more confident using CSS Grid in projects.

<br>

### Useful resources üíé

- Ahmed Karimzade
- WebAim accessibility checker
- Forge icons
- CSS box shadows
- Text faces
  -Firebase
- Email.js
- Dicebear avatars
- Undraw

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) - Inkscape SVG Editor. I use it all the time when I'm working on any web project. After designing the project, I used Inkscape's in-built tools to help me figure out the _spacing_, _sizing_ and _positioning_ of elements throughout the project. To better understand how I approached coding the project using Inkscape, have a look at this repository I made - [Designing and Coding Layouts](https://github.com/AllanKirui/designing-and-coding-layouts)
